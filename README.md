## Vision
Architecting and safeguarding the post-biological man-machine interface layer through cryptographically secure, ethically sound, and ecologically harmonious augmentative technologies.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build secure bootloader
make bootloader

# Run tests
make test

# Formal verification
make verify
```
